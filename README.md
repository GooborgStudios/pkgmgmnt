# Gooborg Studios' pkgmgmnt (working title)
A cross-platform package manager GUI written in PyQt5 for Homebrew, Apt, Pip, and NPM.

**pkgmgmnt is currently in the initial development stages and is not ready for real use.**

## What is pkgmgmnt?
pkgmgmnt is a graphical interface for various package managers across all operating systems, written in Python and Qt5 for cross-platform convenience.  Back up from the command line and let the GUI do its magic.

## Is this a brand new package manager?
No, pkgmgmnt is an extension on your existing package manager, designed to help you spend less time writing commands, and more time writing code.  pkgmgmnt works with Homebrew, Apt, Pip, and NPM.
